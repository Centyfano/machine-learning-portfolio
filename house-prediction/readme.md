# House Price Prediction

This project implements linear regression ML, whereby the model is trained to predict the prices of houses in Nairobi based on a number of features.

The features used are:

-   Location (estate)
-   House type
    -   Townhouse
    -   House
    -   Apartment
    -   Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
-   Number of bedrooms/bathrooms

And the label is the house price

The `data/` directory stores the data file used, both the raw, unprocessed `rents.json`, as well as the processed output files.

Processing of the data is done in the `preprocess.ipynb` notebook
